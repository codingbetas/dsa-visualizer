This project helps students and developers understand how different data structures work and how algorithms execute step by step.

## Features

- Visualize arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs
- Step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)
- Highlighted operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
- Easy-to-use interface
